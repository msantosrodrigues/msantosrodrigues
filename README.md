My name is Matheus and I'm a natural-born communicator. 

I'm very skilled at explaining, persuading, and conversing. But to be truly convincing, I needed to back up what I was saying. 

That's where data comes in.

Data explains, substantiates, and convinces my decisions and (should) those of many businesses. That's why it's useful. To do this, I use my skills in analysis, **Python, SQL, and data visualization (Tableau, Looker and PowerBI)** to build scenarios, overviews, and provide insights to my colleagues so that we can make the best business decisions possible.

I have already executed deals with these skills in tech, retail, and marketing companies, covering areas as diverse as products, sales, and business.

Here you will see a sample of how I think and turn this data into good decisions and, above all, profits for businesses.
