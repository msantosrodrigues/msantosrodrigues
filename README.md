My name is Matheus and I'm very skilled at explaining, persuading, and conversing. 

*But what it does have with being a data analyst/scientist?*

To be truly convincing, I needed to back up what I was saying. 
That's where data comes in.

**I use my skills in analysis, Python, SQL, and data visualization (Tableau, Looker and PowerBI)** to build scenarios, overviews, and convince my colleagues and peers of what's the best way to face and tackle a challenge.

I have already executed those stunts in tech, retail, and marketing companies, covering areas as diverse as products, sales, and business.

Here you will see a sample of how I think and turn this data into good decisions and, above all, profits for businesses.
